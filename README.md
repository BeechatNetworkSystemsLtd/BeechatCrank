# Beechat Crank
## _The last charger you'll ever need_

![BNSLTD](https://beechat.network/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/powered-by-1.png)

Beechat Crank is a human-powered, open-hardware, fully-waterproof, electricity generator.
The project was born out of the need to power electronics in all off-grid scenarios. We needed a way to power our devices in all weather conditions, and making a human-powered generator meant that problem could be solved. When we looked for a solution, we didn't find what we were looking for, so we decided to make it, and make it open source!

## Features

- High power (3A) USB-C IPX8 output
- 18650 battery 
- Charging time of 4 hrs 24 min. to full charge with 10% efficiency loss at 4.5 Watts.
- Overcharge protection

## Parts

1. Beechat Crank is composed of the main device, which we call the _Heart_. It contains the battery, the generator and all the electronics (the handle is detachable) :

2. The _Pedal Case_ is an assembly which the _Heart_ can be attached in. which dramatically speeds up the charging from 2.5 hours to 25-30 minutes. This is achieved with reduction gears to, with the same revolutions per minute, generate more electricity.

## _Generator_ part
We have chosen the 35L048B1B motor with a mass of 88 grams, giving us us 450 mA for each phase of the coil and works at 5V. 
The wire leads are connected via female Molex connectors to the charging PCB board.
